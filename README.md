# -Arduino-LM35-Temperature-Control
An Arduino project utilizing the LM35 temperature sensor to monitor ambient temperature. The onboard LED responds dynamically, blinking at different rates based on temperature conditions. This project demonstrates temperature conversion, analog-to-digital conversion, and LED control without using standard delay functions.
